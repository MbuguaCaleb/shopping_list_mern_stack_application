**Hooks vs ClassBased Components**

```
By default classes have life cycle methods which are set the state example component did Mount.
Hooks bring an alternative way of setting your state without calling the class default methods.
Traditionally react was more efficient with classes but after introduction of hooks they are more
functional.

Dimistification between classes and hooks is only with how you render your state.And how Lifecycle methods are called

```

**ClassBased state**

```
this.setstate sets the state when you are using a class...Remember the great role that the spread operator plays in referring to the current state items.

Spread operator [...]takes in the current state.
